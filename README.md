# Books Recommendation System

A small project on Books Recommendation System using unsupervised ML algorithm Nearest Neighbors and deployment using streamlit library.

# Requirement

To recommendend books based on similar genre and user's ratings.

# Steps Involved

    1. Collection of data.
    2. Analysis and Preprocessing of data.
    3. EDA
    4. Feature Scaling if required.
    5. Featuring Selection
    6. Model Building
    7. Hyperparameter Tuning
    8. Deployment

# Description

Data is imported to python environment where it is analysed and preprocessed.
EDA, Feature scaling and selection is done where ever applicable.
Model is built and trained using Nearest Neighbors.
Validation Check is done using distances from Nearest Neighbors.
Finally it is serialized and deserialized using pickle and therefore deployed
using Streamlit.
